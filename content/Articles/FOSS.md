I sit here thinking about the data journey and sometimes wonder how I arrived here.  After going down the rabbit hole through much of Covid I have come out on the other side living having learned a ton, and finding myself embracing FOSS, or something like it anyway.

I am still a user of proprietary software so I am not a zealot, but as I sit here typing on a new install of Ubuntu Desktop (on a Surface Laptop... running a custom kernel, made possible by FOSS) I realize how much more potential there is in open source than proprietary software.  Clearly this is no secret to Microsoft who has made much of their code for newer programs openly and readily available.  

Lately the projects have been gravitating towards Flask web apps in Python integrating with Microsoft SQL Server.  If I get adventurous I might actually write a post one day about one of these, as I think there is a distinct lack of Python + MS SQL Server documentation out there that is easily usable.
