It has been an adventure.  I am not ashamed to admit that in the process of trying to create this blog, I definitely had to do a hard delete of my entire git repo before rebuilding everything and moving on.  Finally got there and it is great.

For those not in the know, you'll also find about a million and a half ways to run Python on a Mac and most of them are downright terrible.  My personal preference at this point is just to install Anaconda and run the terminal from the Anaconda virtual env, but to each their own.

I thought it would be cool to create a blog using Python instead of Wordpress or something else.  I set out to do so and now it is fully published on the net and ready to be seen.
